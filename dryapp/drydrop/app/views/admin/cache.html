			Here you can see list of currently cached items by this FreefallCDN site.
		</p>
		<p>
			FreefallCDN site acts as a cache for your GitHub content. When someone requests resource at given URL, FreefallCDN looks into the cache and serve item directly whenever possible.
			In a case the cache entry is missing, FreefallCDN tries to fetch the item from GitHub and store it in cache for later requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			What about updating? In case you have correctly setup GitHub post commit hook for your repo.
			When you push updated content to your GitHub repository, GitHub will ping FreefallCDN and FreefallCDN then invalidates all changed items by that push. 
			This way next time when someone requests updated item cache miss will happen and FreefallCDN downloads fresh content from GitHub.
